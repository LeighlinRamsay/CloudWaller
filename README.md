# CloudWaller
AWS Cloud Waller is a plugin-based Python tool that runs 90+ parallel security checks across one or multiple AWS CLI profiles and regions. It outputs grouped ASCII text, machine-readable JSON, or ASFF for Security Hub ingestion, and is easily extensible via custom plugins for proactive misconfiguration detection.
